//! The brain. Coordinates ingest → ring buffer → egress with:
//!   * dynamic delay (request + apply-at-next-IDR alignment)
//!   * monotonic output timestamp rewriting
//!   * input-starvation filler frames so the Twitch session stays alive
//!
//! Concurrency model: the ingest task calls `on_tag` synchronously (it
//! does only an indexed disk write + a notify). The egress task runs as
//! its own loop in `run_egress`, owning the connection to the upstream
//! platform. Communication is via `Controller`'s shared state + Notify.
