//! Shared `ureq` agent factory that selects native-tls as the TLS
//! provider and lets callers see 4xx response bodies.
//!
//! ureq 3.x changes vs the 2.x setup we used to have:
//!
//!   - TLS backend selection moved from an imperative `tls_connector()`
//!     call (with a hand-built `native_tls::TlsConnector`) to a
//!     declarative `TlsConfig::builder().provider(TlsProvider::NativeTls)`.
//!     The `native-tls` cargo feature on `ureq` wires the real
//!     `native_tls` crate in for us - we just have to tell ureq to
//!     prefer it over the rustls default.
//!
//!   - 4xx / 5xx responses default to `Err(Error::StatusCode(u16))`,
//!     which DROPS the response body. The Twitch
//!     `GetClientConfiguration` proxy needs the body in the 4xx case
//!     to surface why the EB allocation failed; flipping
//!     `http_status_as_error(false)` on the agent moves non-2xx into
//!     the Ok branch so we can read the body before deciding.
//!
//!   - Timeouts moved from per-builder methods (`.timeout_connect(d)`,
//!     `.timeout(d)`) to an `Option<Duration>` config field on either
//!     the agent or, per-request, via `req.config().timeout_*().build()`.
//!
//! Use [`https_agent`] everywhere we need to call out to an HTTPS URL.
