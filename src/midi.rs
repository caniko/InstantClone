//! MIDI controller bindings for the delay actions.
//!
//! A background thread (Windows, via winmm) listens to every MIDI input
//! device and turns note-on / control-change "press" edges into signature
//! strings (`note:ch:n` / `cc:ch:n`). Each signature is matched against the
//! user's bindings and routed through `Controller::run_named_action`, the
//! same path the keyboard hotkeys use, so both trigger identical behaviour.
//!
//! `MidiState` is cross-platform: it holds the live bindings mirror, the
//! device list, and the "learn mode" slot the dashboard drives over HTTP.
//! On a build with no MIDI backend the listener never starts, so
//! `available` stays false and the dashboard hides the section - exactly
//! like the keyboard hotkeys on Linux.
