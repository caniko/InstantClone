//! OBS Studio services.json patcher.
//!
//! OBS knows about streaming services through a `services.json` file
//! in the user's `AppData` directory. Each entry declares the server
//! URLs, recommended encoder settings, and - critically for our
//! use-case - the `multitrack_video_configuration_url` that turns on
//! the Enhanced Broadcasting / multi-track-video UI inside OBS.
//!
//! By inserting an InstantClone entry into that file we let the
//! streamer pick us straight from the OBS service dropdown - no
//! Custom-server fiddling, no manual JSON paste, multi-track Video
//! "Auto" buttons work because they hit our local config endpoint.
//!
//! No `serde_json` dependency - the file is well-formed JSON produced
//! by OBS, so a careful string-level insert + an idempotent check by
//! exact-substring match handles all the cases we care about. Every
//! write goes via a `.bak` copy first; if anything goes sideways the
//! user can restore manually.
//!
//! Config-dir resolution (services.json + logs both live under it):
//!   * Windows: `%APPDATA%\obs-studio`, then `%LOCALAPPDATA%\obs-studio`.
//!   * Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/obs-studio` (native / deb), then the Flatpak
//!     and Snap locations.
//!   * macOS: not handled yet (no candidates).

// ── VOD-audio integration: OBS user.ini flag ────────────────────────

// (frontend/settings/OBSBasicSettings_Stream.cpp on master)
//
// IMPORTANT: OBS 32 split the legacy global.ini into two files -
// `global.ini` (app-level) and `user.ini` (user-level) - and
// `GetUserConfig()` now returns user.ini. v0.1.0..0.1.2 wrote the
// flag to global.ini, which OBS 32 simply ignored. Issue #9 was the
// streamer report ("the bypass didn't work") that surfaced this.
//
// Strategy: prefer user.ini when it exists (OBS 32+), fall back to
// global.ini for older installs. On every write we also strip the
// legacy key from global.ini if it's there, so upgraders don't carry
// dead state across files.
//
// We write/remove this flag in lockstep with the per-destination
// `vod_audio` toggle so the streamer doesn't have to hand-edit an INI
// file. The flag is global to the user's OBS - it affects every
// Custom RTMP setup they have, not just InstantClone. That's
// deliberate on OBS's side: they only want power users who understand
// the implication enabling this, which is exactly what our dashboard
// toggle's copy spells out.

/// Pure path-resolution helper: given an OBS install directory
/// (typically `%APPDATA%\obs-studio`), pick the authoritative user
/// config file - user.ini on OBS 32+, falling back to global.ini on

// rtmp-custom plugin only writes `server` / `key` / `use_auth` /
// `username` / `password` to settings, and discards every other key
// in its `rtmp_custom_update` function. That means the injected URL
// is dropped on LOAD (never reaches OBS's MultitrackVideoAutoConfigURL
// lookup), not only on SAVE - so the injection mechanism is dead.
// We keep `inject_vod_eb` / `revert_vod_eb` only for cleanup of stale
// state left behind by v0.1.0..0.1.2. New Phase C is the
// `launch_obs_with_eb_config` helper below: spawn obs64.exe with the
// `--config-url` CLI flag, which is the only path OBS's frontend
// actually honours for Custom RTMP services.
//

// is the user-chosen scope from the dashboard: minimal footprint, the
// user is warned that switching OBS profiles disables the injection.
