//! TCP tuning helpers shared by ingest + egress sockets.
//!
//! Why this matters:
//!   * INGEST: if OBS's process hangs without closing the socket, Windows's
//!     default keepalive (2 hours) means our dashboard reports OBS as
//!     "alive" long after it stopped sending bytes. Aggressive keepalive
//!     surfaces the real state in ~30 s.
//!   * EGRESS: Twitch / NAT / firewall idle-paths sometimes silently drop
//!     long connections. Without probes, we'd only discover a dead socket
//!     on the next send - by then the viewer has been frozen for a while.
//!   * INGEST (IPv6): `set_v6_only` keeps our two listen sockets from
//!     overlapping, and keeps v4 peers from arriving v4-mapped.
//!
//! Implementation: raw `WSAIoctl(SIO_KEEPALIVE_VALS)` / `setsockopt` on
//! Windows and `libc::setsockopt` on Linux (no `socket2` dependency),
//! no-op stubs on platforms we do not publish.
//!
//! Not every helper needs both halves, and the ones that do not say why at
//! the stub. Treat a silent `Ok(())` here as a claim that the platform
//! already does the right thing, not as a gap - `set_aggressive_keepalive`
//! was such a stub on Linux by oversight, and the result was a build that
//! set no keepalive at all.
