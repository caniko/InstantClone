//! One-click self-update for the portable Windows build.
//!
//! Updating is optional - the About tab always links the manual download
//! too - but for users who'd rather not fish a new exe out of GitHub, the
//! "Update now" button drives this two-step flow:
//!
//!   1. [`prepare`]: hit the latest GitHub release, download the new exe
//!      and the published `SHA256SUMS.txt`, verify the hash, and stage the
//!      bytes next to the running exe as `instantclone.exe.new`. Everything
//!      that can fail - offline, rate-limited, hash mismatch, unwritable
//!      folder - fails HERE, before the live exe is touched, and surfaces a
//!      message to the UI. Nothing is committed.
//!
//!   2. [`commit_and_relaunch`]: rename the running exe to `.old` (Windows
//!      lets you rename, but not delete/overwrite, a running image), move
//!      the staged `.new` into its place, spawn a tiny detached `cmd` that
//!      waits ~2 s for our TCP ports to free and then relaunches the fresh
//!      exe, and hard-exit. The `.old` / `.new` leftovers are swept on the
//!      next startup (see [`sweep_leftovers`]).
//!
//! Why the checksum matters: we download an executable and then run it, so
//! verifying it against the hash the release pipeline published (over a
//! separate TLS-protected request) is the line between "convenient" and
//! "remote code execution". A mismatch aborts with zero changes made.
//!
//! The user's config lives in a separate file, so settings, destinations,
//! and overlays are untouched by the swap.
