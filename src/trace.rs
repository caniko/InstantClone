//! Wire-level egress trace. Append-only file at `./instantclone-trace.log`
//! that records every event in the publish path: handshake, AMF0 command
//! send/receive, sequence headers, every tag's wire bytes for the first
//! N frames, every IDR, every cut/reanchor event, and periodic stats.
//!
//! Goal: be able to compare what InstantClone sends to a platform with
//! what OBS sends directly, byte-for-byte and tick-for-tick. The dashboard
//! log buffer (512 entries) is way too small for that; this writes
//! straight to disk with no rate limit.
//!
//! Off by default for end users - `main` calls `set_enabled` with
//! whichever value `settings.tracing_enabled` carries, and that
//! defaults to `false` on a fresh install. Streamers reporting a bug
//! flip it on in System → Advanced diagnostics, reproduce, and send
//! the file. `INSTANTCLONE_NO_TRACE=1` is a separate hard-kill that
//! disables the whole subsystem regardless of the runtime atomic.
//! Managed mode retains event categories and timing only: detail strings may
//! contain credential-file endpoints or credentials echoed by a remote server.
//! Each managed instance uses `<CONFIG_PATH>.trace.log` so its writer and cap
//! remain isolated even when landscape and portrait share a working directory.
//!
//! Writes are protected by a mutex; the hot path is a single locked
//! `writeln!` per event, which at typical ~30 fps is ~3000 lines / s on
//! a busy stream - well under disk-write contention thresholds. The
//! file still grows fast enough (≈ 6 MB / 10 min at 8 Mbps) that an
//! always-on default is the wrong call for a typical streamer; reserve
//! the cost for users who are actively diagnosing.
